Here are some random Python packages & utilities that I find useful while developing:

- [pipreqs](https://github.com/bndr/pipreqs): Generate requirements.txt files based on import statements in your code
- [loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru): A Python logger that's actually fun to use
- [better-exceptions](https://github.com/Qix-/better-exceptions): Enhanced error messages (colors, variable values, ...) every time you get an exception (great for post-hoc debugging)
- [terminalizer](https://github.com/faressoft/terminalizer): Record gifs right from your terminal (great for demos + READMEs)
- [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip): Preview README files exactly as they appear on Github
- [knockknock](https://github.com/huggingface/knockknock): Send notifications (Slack, e-mail, ...) when a long-running task finishes (useful for machine learning)
- [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/): Build CLIs quickly based on Python type hints
